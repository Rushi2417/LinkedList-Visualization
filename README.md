# LinkedList-Visualization

-Developed a LinkedList Visualization Project focusing on enhancing understanding and interaction with data structures.
-Implemented features allowing users to add, remove, set, and insert nodes dynamically.
-Utilized intuitive visual representations to depict LinkedList operations, fostering easier comprehension for users.
-Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

# Featues

-Add Node: Users can add nodes to the linked list by inputting values through a user-friendly interface. Upon submission, the new node is dynamically displayed within the linked list visualization.

-Remove Node: The application allows users to remove nodes from the linked list. By selecting a specific node, users can initiate the removal process, and the linked list visualization updates accordingly, reflecting the changes in real-time.

-Set Value: Users have the option to modify the value of any existing node within the linked list. By selecting a node and entering a new value, users can update the node's content seamlessly.

-Insert Node: The project supports node insertion at any desired position within the linked list. Through simple interactions, users can specify the position and value of the new node, and the visualization updates to reflect the insertion operation.

-Visual Representation: The heart of the project lies in its ability to visually represent the linked list structure. Each node is represented graphically, allowing users to comprehend the relationships between nodes and understand the flow of data within the linked list.
